## To use ESP-IDF:

1. Run `/opt/esp-idf/install.sh` to install ESP-IDF to `~/.espressif`.
   You only have to do this once after installing or upgrading
   the esp-idf package.

2. Run `source /opt/esp-idf/export.sh` to add `idf.py` and `idf_tools.py`
   to your current PATH. You will have to do this in every terminal
   where you want to use ESP-IDF. Alternatively, you can add
   `source /opt/esp-idf/export.sh` to `~/.bashrc` or the equivalent for
   your shell to load ESP-IDF automatically in all terminals.
